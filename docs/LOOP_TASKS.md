# Autonomous Loop Tasks

This file is the queue for long-running agents. Work top to bottom. When a task is completed,
commit it and continue to the next task without waiting for a new prompt.

## Completed Loops

### L1: C++ Runtime Spine

Status: completed as diagnostic runtime spine on 2026-06-09.

Deliver:

- `CMakeLists.txt`
- `src/yuengine/...`
- `apps/yuengine_cli`
- runtime boot diagnostics for both sample projects

Acceptance:

- CMake configure/build passes.
- `yuengine_cli validate samples/touhou_new_world/project.json` passes.
- `yuengine_cli boot samples/touhou_new_world/project.json` loads project, mounts VFS, loads
  preload and title `.sqasm`, and reports native/API obligations.
- `yuengine_cli boot samples/empty_project/project.json` boots without original resources.

Verified:

- CMake BuildTools 14.43/Ninja build passes.
- CTest passes 4/4.
- Python unittest suite passes 6/6.
- Original sample diagnostic boot reports:
  - loose mounts: 2
  - pack resources: 13,028
  - native registry APIs: 84
  - loaded modules: preload and titlemenu
  - title/preload obligations: 36, all `not_started`
- Empty sample diagnostic boot reports:
  - loose mounts: 1
  - native registry APIs: 84
  - native obligations: 0

Boundary: this is diagnostic boot only. It is not script execution or gameplay.

## Active Loop

### L2: VFS And Pack Manifest Depth

Deliver:

- resource registry with normalized paths;
- pack-manifest indexed resources;
- loose resource lookup;
- stem expansion;
- title and first mission resource dependency diagnostics.

Acceptance:

- title background/logo/DLC stems resolve to language variants.
- `map/doujou/doujou.sge` and `map/doujou/doujou.rcm` resolve through project mounts.

### L3: Script Module Model

Deliver:

- `.sqasm` parser in C++ preserves functions, literals, instructions, callsites, resource refs;
- module dependency/call summary;
- obligation extraction by service owner.

Acceptance:

- title module reports 81 functions, 4466 instructions, 593 calls.
- first mission module reports 62 functions, 4068 instructions, 640 calls.

### L4: Native Service Interfaces

Deliver:

- C++ service interfaces for the 11 P6 services;
- native registry maps API name -> service -> implementation state;
- unimplemented calls raise tracked obligations.

Acceptance:

- 84 title/first-mission APIs are present in registry.
- no call used by current boot scope is unowned.

### L5: Service-Backed Runtime Lifecycle

Deliver:

- service container for core/project/VFS/script/native layers;
- deterministic boot phases with explicit diagnostics;
- preload and entry-module ownership by Script Service;
- native/API obligation emission through Native Service interfaces.

Acceptance:

- original and empty sample still pass boot diagnostics.
- no script-visible native/API call can disappear as a silent no-op.
- R1 remains diagnostic boot until original scripts execute; do not mark R2 here.

### L6: Oracle Capture Execution

Deliver:

- actual title boot captures if capture tools or user-driven run are available;
- three-run stability report.

Acceptance:

- title boot trace maps to `titlemenu.b64`.
- save list/resource/audio/render observations are recorded or explicitly blocked.

### L7: Title Script Execution

Deliver:

- Squirrel VM plan/embedding or bytecode execution bridge;
- title script dispatch through native service registry;
- UI/render command buffer begins from script calls.

Acceptance:

- no hand-written replacement menu.
- every missing native call is a named obligation.

### L8: Save/New Game And Scene Entry

Deliver:

- save/profile/scenario service behavior from evidence/oracle;
- `MakeNewGame` / `StartGame` path;
- scene/stage service load diagnostics.

Acceptance:

- StartGame selects a mission candidate through data/service state, not hard-coded scene boot.

## Stop Conditions

Do not stop unless:

- the full target is achieved;
- a hard blocker requires user action and no non-blocked loop task remains;
- the user explicitly interrupts or redirects.
